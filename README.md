# calculatePi
Calculate PI using the random number generator.
This program calculates the number &pi;

Usually this done using an infinate series. However, it can also be calculated using the randon number generator.

Suppose we have the following: 
* Theere is a square with sides of length 2 centered at the origin. 
* There is a circle with radius of 1 centered at the origin.
* Now suppose a point P(x,y) is randomly generated with the values for x and y being between -1 and 1.

This is shown in the following diagram

Now let P<sub>c;</sub> = the probability that point P is inside the circle.

This can be calculated by dividing the area of the cirle by the area of the sqaure.

The area of the square is (2)(2) = 4.

The area of the cirlce is r<sup>2</sup> &pi; where r is 1 so the area of the cirle is just &pi
